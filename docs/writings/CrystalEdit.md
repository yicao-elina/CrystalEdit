\icmltitle{CrystalEdit: Benchmarking and Enhancing Large Language Models for Physics-Aware Crystal Structure Manipulation}

\begin{abstract}The rapid advancement of generative AI in materials science has enabled de novo crystal structure generation, yet a critical capability remains underexplored: precise, user-guided modification of existing crystal structures while preserving physical validity. Analogous to advanced image editing tools that enable fine-grained control with high fidelity, materials science lacks robust methods for "crystal editing" - the ability to make targeted structural modifications based on natural language instructions while maintaining crystallographic consistency and thermodynamic plausibility.

Here, we introduce CrystalEdit, a framework that enables large language models (LLMs) to perform precise crystal structure manipulations through natural language queries. We address three fundamental challenges: (1) developing physics-aware representations that capture both local atomic environments and global crystallographic constraints, (2) creating a multi-modal interface that combines textual instructions with structural context, and (3) implementing validation mechanisms that ensure edited structures remain physically meaningful.

Our approach combines hierarchical crystal representations, physics-informed prompting strategies, and iterative refinement with computational validation. We demonstrate CrystalEdit's capabilities across diverse manipulation tasks including selective doping, defect introduction, strain engineering, and surface modifications. Benchmarking against traditional computational methods shows that CrystalEdit achieves comparable structural accuracy while offering unprecedented flexibility and accessibility for non-expert users.

We evaluate our framework on a comprehensive dataset of crystal editing tasks, showing X\% improvement in task completion rate and Y\% better preservation of physical properties compared to existing approaches. CrystalEdit represents a paradigm shift from generation-focused to editing-focused materials AI, opening new possibilities for interactive materials design and democratizing access to sophisticated crystal engineering capabilities.
